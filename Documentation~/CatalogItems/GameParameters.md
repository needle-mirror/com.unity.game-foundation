# Game Parameters

## Overview

A __Game Parameter__ is a [catalog item] providing static configuration for your game.  
A __game parameter__ works pretty much the same than any other [catalog items], except they don't have a `display name`.  
The game parameter is static data that you can use to describe a piece of configuration of your game.  
You can create __Game Parameter__ objects, then define static properties to further define that concept.

## Editor Overview

Open the __Game Parameter window__ by going to __Window → Game Foundation → Game Parameters__.
The __Game Parameter__ window will let you configure game parameters.

In the example above, we've created a __Game Parameter__ per level of the game.  
That can be an approach to setup the difficulty, or switch on/off some features.
